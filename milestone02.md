## Working Routes
* / - Main page has some styling and placeholders for now
* /login - Form fully working
    * Not very pretty though. I'm thinking about implementing SASS or Bootstrap so I didn't want to style too much now
* /signup - Another form, also fully working
* /<username> - reads from database and displays some information
    * This will have more information and styling in the finished version

## Research Topics
* User Authentication (using Passport js) working for user signup
* Grunt is working with uglify, cssmin and htmlmin for minification of the project
